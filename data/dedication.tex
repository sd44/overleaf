\begin{dedication}
  Rulers, Statesmen, Nations, are wont to be emphatically commended to the
  teaching which experience offers in history. But what experience and history
  teach is this --- that peoples and governments never have learned anything
  from history, or acted on principles deduced from it. Each period is involved
  in such peculiar circumstances, exhibits a condition of things so strictly
  idiosyncratic, that its conduct must be regulated by considerations connected
  with itself, and itself alone.
